# CLI-Dictionary

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MaxKam/CLI-Dictionary.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MaxKam/CLI-Dictionary)

A simple command line dictionary written in Python. Will give suggestions if word is misspelled and allow you to see definiton of suggestion.

## Simple installation

Simplest method to use this app on a Linux computer is to save the files somewhere on your computer and run this command in terminal:
`alias `*`command_name`*`="python `*`path_to_file`*`"`

An example:
`alias getdef="python ~/cli_dictionary/cli_dictionary.py`

Then the app can be be run by simply typing in your alias, which will then prompt for a word. Or by typing in your alias and the word you want the definition for,
which will print out the definition if it is found.
